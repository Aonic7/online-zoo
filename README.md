# Online-zoo
Online-zoo is a platform that contains information about animals from various zoos with webcams. It is assumed that a user can open the page with zoo resources, observe one of the animals, or make a donation that will be used to purchase food. As part of the task, we should make an adaptive layout and interactivity of the main page, and the page with donations.
